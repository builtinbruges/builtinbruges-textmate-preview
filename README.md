### Yosemite Textmate2 Preview Theme

I was getting pretty sick of the default "bright" markdown preview in TextMate2 so I decided to create my own theme that matches the general OS X 10.10 Yosemite look and feel.

- Double click the `Yosemite Textmate2 Preview.tmbundle` file. TextMate should ask you if you'd like it to install the bundle.
- Done! "Yosemite" is now available in the web preview window.
